Wi-Fi Based Location Research Tool

This android project was developed as a research tool for a four part master’s thesis project aimed to develop an indoor location system for smartphones. As this project relies on a server (not available in any public repository) to get some spatial information, the app compiled from it won’t be able to generate the synthetic Wi-Fi RSSI reading map. However, the manual RSSI gathering functionality is still available which allows a full location demo.
